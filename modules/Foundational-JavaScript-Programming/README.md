# Foundational JavaScript Programming

In this module we're going to cover some of the basics of general programming
as well as the basics of programming in JavaScript. You might have covered some
of this before you arrived at the guild but make sure you have these skills

## Glossary of Terms

### General Programming

| Term         | Explanation |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| String       | An ordered list of text characters |
| Number       | An object type representing either an Integer or a Float |
| Object       | A data structure |
| Array        | An array is an ordered set of values that you refer to with a name and an index. |
| Hash         | A data type mapping keys to values |
| Index        | AKA Hash |
| Map          | AKA Hash |
| Function     | A code snippet that can be called by other code or by itself, or a variable that refers to the function. When a function is called, arguments are passed to the function as input, and the function can optionally return an output. A function in JavaScript is also an object. |
| Boolean      | A logical data type that can have only the values true or false |
| Conditional  | A set of rules that can interrupt normal code execution or change it, depending on whether the condition is true or not |
| Literal      | A way of declaring an object as it is literally meant to be interpreted |
| Truthy       | A value that translates to true when evaluated in a Boolean context |
| Falsy        | A value that translates to false when evaluated in a Boolean context |
| Comment      | A part of your source code that is ignored by the computed and is meant for other developers to read |
| Error        | An unindented event or outcome |
| Syntax Error | A error that is thrown when your source code is written incorrectly |

### JavaScript Specific

| Term           | Explanation |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| Number         | In JavaScript, Number is a numeric data type that can represent both an Integer and a Float |
| Object         | Almost all values in JavaScript are objects |
| ReferenceError | The error that is thrown when your code attempts to use something that was not declared |
